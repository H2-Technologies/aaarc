        The Ashland Area Amateur Radio Club operates three repeaters. There are
        two 2-meter repeaters and one 70-centimeter repeater. The 2-meter
        repeaters are located in Widowville, just south of Ashland, and at the
        WZLP Radio Tower in Loudonville. The 70-centimeter repeater is located
        0.7 miles North of I-71 at mile marker 187. The repeaters are open to
        all licensed amateur radio operators. The club also operates a weekly
        net on the 2-meter repeater located in Widowville. The net is held every
        Thursday at 6:00 PM. All licensed amateur radio operators are welcome to
        check in. The net is a directed net and is used to pass traffic and to
        provide a forum for amateur radio operators to discuss topics of
        interest. The net is also used to provide information about upcoming
        club events and activities.
